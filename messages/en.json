They envisioned a space that embodies their cultural heritage and love for the island, giving birth to Chamana. This restaurant and boutique not only honor their roots but also capture Ibiza's mystical and vibrant energy. One sister, a fashion designer, has her own artisanal brand, collaborating with indigenous artisans from Argentina. 'La Botica,' a corner within the restaurant, sells handcrafted clothing and accessories from Argentina and around the world. The other sister, a homeopathic pharmacist by trade, has always been creating concoctions. Growing up in a family immersed in bars and gastronomy, they inherited a love for this world. Chamana is not just a place to eat and drink; it is a sensory journey where every detail is designed to spark curiosity and connect with the essence of nature and spirituality. Welcome to Chamana, where Argentina and Ibiza embrace in an eternal hug."
